StagBL Documentation
--------------------

Like all of StagBL, we want the documentation to be lean and mean.
As much as possible, documentation should be by example.
StagBLDemo provides most of this, demonstrating functionality in terms of reproducing
standard examples and benchmarks.

Some unit/integration tests in tests/ might also do double duty as examples.

All additional documentation will be presented in .rst or .md format, so that it 
is both easily human-readable and easily rendered to html.
