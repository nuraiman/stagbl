StagBL Demos
------------

StagBLDemo2d and StagBLDemo3d are two mini-apps designed for several purposes:

1. To provide general examples of usage of StagBL. Whenever possible, these demos will be used
   as examples/tutorials.
2. "The path to performance," To demonstrate how programs similar to those in Gerya's textbook may be written with StagBL
3. To reproduce simple benchmarks with StagBL
4. To provide application testing for StagBL
5. To provide platforms for performance testing, particular for emerging architectures and HPC systems.
