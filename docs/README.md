StagBL Documentation
--------------------

Like all of StagBL, the documentation is intended to be minimal and maintainable.
As much as possible, documentation is by example.
StagBLDemo provides most of this, demonstrating functionality in terms of reproducing
standard examples and benchmarks.

Some unit/integration tests in tests/ might also do double duty as examples.

Any additional documentation will be generated using Sphinx (based on .rst files).
