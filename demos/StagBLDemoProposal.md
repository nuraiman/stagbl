StagBLDemo proposal
-------------------

StagBLDemo2d and StagBLDemo3d are two mini-apps designed for several purposes:

1. To provide general examples of usage of StagBL. Whenever possible, these demos will be used
   as examples/tutorials. This means that the should be carefully coded so as to be clear to the user,
   and in some cases may sacrific efficiency/generality/etc. for didactic usefulness.
2. "The path to performance," To demonstrate how programs similar to those in Gerya's textbook may be written with StagBL
3. To reproduce simple benchmarks with StagBL
4. To provide application testing for StagBL (see tests/)
