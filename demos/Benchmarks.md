Here, we collect a list of benchmarks.

An eventual aim might be to cover relevant ones (i.e. those which are useful for 
testing correctness and performance of things the library offers) with StagBLDemo,
and have a list of the StagBL website listing these benchmarks, links to papers with details,
a picture from StagBL, and links to data from other packages performing the benchmark.

This table also needs to be something easily exportable for presentations and other material.

TODO: add papers from Section 4.3 of http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~pjt/papers/tackley2008pepi_yinyang.pdf
TODO: add the papers from R. Davies in this email: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#all/155e3912031c3d18
