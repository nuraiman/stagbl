Toy 3
-----

Similar to toy 2, but 
 - Relies on a development branch of PETSc, which includes DMStag : psanan/dmstag at bitbucket.org/psanan/petsc-private/
 - Relying on this same branch, interacts with DMSwarm to passively advect particles

This can and probably should be extended to solve problem 8.4 in Gerya's textbook.
