Rough notes of ideas for the API for DMStag
------------------------------------------

DM API:


Additional Functions:

- Creation Routines mirroring DMDA
- Convert to DMPlex?
- Convert to set of DMDAs?
- Interpolate a field from one sub-grid to another (with swappable logic to do so)? e.g. create a 2/3-dof interpolated velocity field on the cells
- Some notion of "labels" (maybe using DMLabel) to define boundaries and apply BCs?
